python json library
    import json
    https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_json.asp

    Use that instead of SQL since Foundry uses Json already?

sql tables
    spells
        ID (primary)
        name
        classes
            column for each class/subclass with a lvl or dictionary with each class as a key and lvl the value?
        lvl
            May not be needed if combo lvl in with class(es) above
        image
            URL to where it's at, or convert to webp and store in db?
        casting time
        duration
        range
        area
        shape
        attack
        save
        dmg effect
        school
        source
            list if in more than one source, or a separate column for each source, SRD + books + homebrew, which would be easier to build sorting around this field?
        components
        material component
        ritual
        concentration
    feats
        name, source, list of effects, prerequisite
        maybe a column for +/- to CR?
        tags: dndbeyond has them, do other sources list tags?
    features
    monsters
    races
    equipment
    backgrounds
    skills
    languages
    separate tables for homebrewed vs SRD/raw?
