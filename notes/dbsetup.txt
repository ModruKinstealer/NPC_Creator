    sources
        id (primary)
        user_id not null
            this way when someone creates a new thing they can be added as a source and they
            decide if public or private, maybe give permission to specific users if they want to
            share with friends?
                Lookup by name or email?
                for srd/raw stuff use my user ID or admin id something like that
            foreign key(user_id) references users(id)
        abr text not null
            hbrew for homebrewed stuff?
        name text not null
            full name of book, or for homebrewed stuff user name
                maybe have a field they can fill in if they want to associate stuff with a world or campaign
        publisher text
            publisher company name or user name for homebrewed stuff
        minAccess number not null
            default access lvl


    spells
        id (primary)
        name text not null
        classes text not null 
            I think in spells just have lvl, then have another table that is a list of classes with the spell's id number for each spell on their list
            that way when you add a class you a can determine which spells go with it. Also that feels like it'd be easier to manage especially when homebrewed classes
            and spells start coming into play.

            May not be needed if combo lvl in with class(es) above
