Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal markings, indicating its mystical origin.</p><p>In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/actions.html#dodge_phb\">Dodge</a> action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action.

Yet many generations of study gave rise to various styles of Bladesinging based on the melee weapon employed. The techniques of these styles are passed from master to students in small schools, some of which have a building dedicated to instruction. Even the newest styles are hundreds of years old, but are still taught by their original creators due to the long lives of elves. Most schools of Bladesinging are in Evermeet or Evereska. One was started in Myth Drannor, but the city's destruction has scattered those students who survived.</p><p>Styles of Bladesinging are broadly categorized based on the type of weapon employed, and each is associated with a category of animal. Within that style are specializations named after specific animal types, based on the types of spells employed, the techniques of the master, and the particular weapon used. Bladesingers who apprentice to a master typically get a tattoo of their chosen style's animal. Some bladesingers learn multiple styles and bear many tattoos, wearing a warning on their skin of their deadly skills.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3403\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cat.</span></span> <p>Styles that employ a sword belong to this family. The lion style, the eldest, trains practitioners in the use of the longsword and doesn't favor any particular type of spells. Leopard style focuses on the shortsword and spells of illusion and stealth. Red tiger, a style just three centuries old, has its bladesingers using the scimitar in a whirling dance of defense from which they launch into sudden leaps and attacks.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3404\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bird.</span></span> <p>Styles that focus on the use of a hafted weapon, such as an axe or hammer, have been grouped together as bird styles, yet they vary wildly. All relatively new styles, they use weapons not typically favored by elves. Eagle-style bladesingers use small handaxes, and many maneuvers in the style focus on fluid ways to throw the weapon and draw a new one. Raven style uses a war pick, and spells associated with it grant the bladesinger more agility in combat.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3405\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Snake.</span></span> <p>Practitioners of these styles use a flail, chain, or whip. Viper style uses a whip, despite its inelegance as a weapon, and has almost as long a history as the lion style. Its masters punctuate their bladesong with a stunningly rapid rhythm of whip cracks, which can keep many foes at bay and allow the bladesinger space to cast the cruel spells of poison and disease favored by the style.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3406\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Extra Attack</span></span> <p>Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/actions.html#attack_phb\">Attack</a> action on your turn.

If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#mending_phb\">mending</a> spell is cast on it, it regains [[/r 2d6]] hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.</p><p>When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it.

The swarm becomes a potent force in battle, as well as helpful company for the ranger. Some Swarmkeepers are outcasts or hermits, keeping to themselves and their attendant swarms rather than dealing with the discomfort of others. Other Swarmkeepers enjoy building vibrant communities that work for the mutual benefit of all those they consider part of their swarm.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3091\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gathered Swarm</span></span> <p><i>3rd-level Swarmkeeper feature</i></p><p>A swarm of intangible nature spirits has bonded itself to you and can assist you in battle.

For more guidance on customizing spells, see the \"Personalizing Spells\" section in chapter 3.</p><p>Also, remember that the swarm's appearance is yours to customize, and don't feel confined to a single appearance.

The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster's spells, while also providing methods for wizards to bolster their own defenses.</p><p>Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents' attempts to counterattack. War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters' magical energy against them.</p><p>In great battles, a war mage often works with evokers, abjurers, and other types of wizards. Evokers, in particular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense.
